# Caracal

Caracal is a Continuous Practice and Assessment Tool for students learning java. This program was built for an Ed Tech class I am taking at GA Tech. This app is built using node.js, socket.io, Bootstrap, and some plain HTML/CSS/JS. Currently, Caracal could be used to practice arithmetic, string and vocab questions in java. The arithmetic and string questions and auto-generated and increase the level of difficulty with each correct question. Feel free to extend an/or reuse the code as you see fit.
